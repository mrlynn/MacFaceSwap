        <h2>Installation Guide</h2>
        <p>Welcome to MacFaceSwap! This guide will walk you through the installation process and help you get started with basic face swapping.</p>
        
        <h3>System Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>macOS 11.0 or later</li>
          <li>4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)</li>
          <li>2GB free disk space</li>
          <li>Intel or Apple Silicon processor</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>Installation Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Download the latest DMG file from our website</li>
          <li>Double-click the DMG file to mount it</li>
          <li>Drag MacFaceSwap to your Applications folder</li>
          <li>Right-click the app and select "Open" for first-time launch</li>
        </ol>
  
        <h3>First Launch</h3>
        <p>When you first launch MacFaceSwap, you'll need to grant camera permissions if you plan to use real-time face swapping. The app will guide you through this process.</p>
  
        <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
        <p>Let's walk through the basic features of MacFaceSwap:</p>
  
        <h3>1. Selecting Source Images</h3>
        <p>Click the "Source Face" button to select the face you want to swap from. This can be any clear, front-facing photo.</p>
  
        <h3>2. Real-time Mode</h3>
        <p>Toggle "Real-time Mode" to use your webcam as the target. The app will automatically detect faces and apply the swap in real-time.</p>
  
        <h3>3. Photo Mode</h3>
        <p>For static images, use "Photo Mode" to select both source and target images. This mode often produces the most precise results.</p>
  
        <h2>Tips for Best Results</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use well-lit, front-facing photos for best results</li>
          <li>Ensure faces are clearly visible and not obscured</li>
          <li>Similar face angles between source and target work best</li>
          <li>Higher resolution images generally produce better results</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Deep Dive: The AI Models Powering MacFaceSwap</h2>
    <p>Face swapping technology has made remarkable strides in recent years. MacFaceSwap leverages state-of-the-art models from the InsightFace framework to deliver high-quality, real-time face swaps. Let's explore the key components that make this possible.</p>
    <h3>The Foundation: InsightFace</h3>
  <p>InsightFace is an open-source face analysis toolkit that provides cutting-edge models for face recognition, detection, and manipulation. MacFaceSwap specifically utilizes two critical components from this framework:</p>

  <h3>Buffalo-L Model for Face Detection</h3>
  <p>The Buffalo-L model serves as our face detection backbone. It's a lightweight yet powerful model that can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Detect multiple faces in a single frame</li>
    <li>Work with various face angles and orientations</li>
    <li>Handle partial occlusions</li>
    <li>Process frames in real-time (60+ FPS on Apple Silicon)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The model uses a modified RetinaFace architecture optimized for speed while maintaining high accuracy. It outputs facial landmarks and bounding boxes that are crucial for the subsequent swapping process.</p>

  <h3>Inswapper Model for Face Swapping</h3>
  <p>The core face swapping functionality comes from the Inswapper model, which employs several innovative techniques:</p>

  <h4>1. Latent Identity Encoding</h4>
  <p>The model first encodes both source and target faces into a latent identity space. This preserves key facial features while allowing for natural blending.</p>

  <h4>2. Expression Preservation</h4>
  <p>Unlike simpler approaches, Inswapper maintains the target's facial expressions, making the swap look more natural in video applications.</p>

  <h4>3. Adaptive Blending</h4>
  <p>The model includes a built-in blending mechanism that handles different skin tones and lighting conditions automatically.</p>

  <h3>Technical Architecture</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Neural Network Type: Modified ResNet architecture</li>
    <li>Input Resolution: 128x128 pixels</li>
    <li>Model Size: ~1.2GB optimized for Apple Silicon</li>
    <li>Processing Pipeline: GPU-accelerated using Metal</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Local Processing & Privacy</h3>
  <p>All model inference happens locally on your device. The models are downloaded once during installation and run entirely offline, ensuring your privacy and data security.</p>
